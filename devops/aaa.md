DevOps isn't about doing the jobs of two persons (software engineer + infra engineer) it's about automating away 1 and being WAY more efficient.

Take a look at how GitHub does DevOps: Make your team’s deploys as boring as hell and stop stressing about it: https://zachholman.com/posts/deploying-software

Take a look at this funny video from Launch Darkly about different approach to DevOps: https://fast.wistia.net/embed/channel/mli3h9o3nh?wchannelid=mli3h9o3nh&wmediaid=g3ifgwu7q0

Take a look at how AWS does DevOps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngnMj1zbMPY

Take a look at how Microsoft does DevOps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X4uziBlC728

Engineering has to build that REPEATABLE DevOps automation @ scale.

The informed definition of DevOps is = "DevOps is the union of people, process, and products to enable continuous delivery of value to your end users." From Microsoft's Donovan Brown - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WW6x0jIPpr0
